- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
Faceting could easily resolve complicated plot consisting of several datasets within one coordinate space. The problems begin when number of  datasets are growning bigger and we could potentially create tens or hundres plot based in the same coordinate space. Their analysis as whole become more diffucult because we could not divide our focus equally between all drawed plots.

- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))

```
```{r}
#1.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
#2.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE)

#3.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE)

#4.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

#5.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv),se = FALSE)

#6.png
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))
```
- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?
| geom                | stat                |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `geom_bar()`        | `stat_count()`      |
| `geom_bin2d()`      | `stat_bin_2d()`     |
| `geom_boxplot()`    | `stat_boxplot()`    |
| `geom_contour()`    | `stat_contour()`    |
| `geom_count()`      | `stat_sum()`        |
| `geom_density()`    | `stat_density()`    |
| `geom_density_2d()` | `stat_density_2d()` |
| `geom_hex()`        | `stat_hex()`        |
| `geom_freqpoly()`   | `stat_bin()`        |
| `geom_histogram()`  | `stat_bin()`        |
| `geom_qq_line()`    | `stat_qq_line()`    |
| `geom_qq()`         | `stat_qq()`         |
| `geom_quantile()`   | `stat_quantile()`   |
| `geom_smooth()`     | `stat_smooth()`     |
| `geom_violin()`     | `stat_violin()`     |
| `geom_sf()`         | `stat_sf()`         |
They use similar naming across the function.

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

`geom_jitter` randomly creates deviation around dataset points to get better understanding of overlapped points by inducing artificial noise into the dataset. `geom_count` is better function to dicriminate and quantify number of overlapped datapoints across the dataset. It shows certain number of overlapped values at any point in plot.

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
# They are correlated mostly linearly. If city mpg value is higher, then hwy mpg is also high. The most economical cars, in terms of consumption of fuel,
# are placed in the upper part of graph, whereas cars with high consumption of fuel are placed mostly at the bottom of plot.
#coord_fixed is neccessary to keep y/x ratio constant across the plot in order to show more consice information without screwing up the perception of plot 
#geom_abiline() calculate and plot linear model slope and intercept in relationship to dataset
```

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
#geom_pointrange() == stat_summary()
```

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
``` 
 
- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?
If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use geom_col()

- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?
Calculation is performed by the (currently undocumented) predictdf generic function and its methods. For most methods the confidence bounds are computed using the predict method - the exceptions are loess which uses a t-based approximation, and for glm where the normal confidence interval is constructed on the link scale, and then back-transformed to the response scale.
1. y - predicted value
2. ymin - lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean
3. ymax - upper pointwise confidence interval around the mean
4. se - standard error

Method, formula, fullrange, level, n, na.rm are parameters which controls how stat_smooth behaves

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
#If group is not set to 1, then all the bars have prop == 1. The function geom_bar assumes that the groups are equal to the x values, since the stat computes the counts within the group.
```
